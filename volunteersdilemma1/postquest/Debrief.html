    <p><b>A study on group decision making</b></p>
    <p>Thank you for participating in this study. We would now like to provide further explanation about this study.</p>
    <p>Our aim is to study a specific type of group situation called a volunteer's dilemma. In this situation there were 3  
        group members. Each group member had to decide whether or not to volunteer to provide a bonus for the whole group. Some 
        participants were part of a minority (based on their cat/dog preferences), and others were part of a majority. With this
         research, we wanted to investigate whether being a minority or majority member influences how such decisions are made. 
         Furthermore, at the end of the study you were asked to fill in some personality questionnaires. By using these questionnaires, 
         we aimed to investigate whether personality variables affect volunteering.</p>
    <p>If you would like to withdraw your consent to use your research data based on the information above, please contact the investigator 
        listed below within two weeks. If you choose to withdraw, this will not negatively affect you or your compensation in any way.</p>
    <p>Please do not share the information in this debriefing letter with other potential participants, as the information could influence their behavior during the study.</p>
